# USAGE MANUAL
---
## 1. Find your target
It'd be good if they were at least a lttle tiny bit interested in you (if you were already friendzoned just let it go, please)


## 2. Send the card
Send them the link and stay mysterious. Say nothing, wait for the answer.


## 3a. If they replied 'yes'
Congrats! You got yourself a partner. Best of luck in your new life!


## 3b. If they replied 'no'
Well, since the card redirects to the marriage certificate anyway, you can still have a partner for life. Just need to use a little bit of force.



## You're welcome!
